# WS-CHAT

## 📚 About the Project
**WS-CHAT** is a web-based chat application developed as a school project. Combining a "sleek" design with "robust" backend functionality, WS-CHAT provides a seamless communication experience with some basic security and great usability.

> [!NOTE]
> Keep in mind this was created relatively quickly—in just a week. The project primarily serves as a simple introduction to WebSockets for learning purposes.
